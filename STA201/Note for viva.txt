Simple linear regression

Simple linear regression analysis is a statistical tool that gives us the ability to estimate the mathematical
relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable.
E(y) = β0 + β1x

The graph of the simple linear regression equation is a straight line; β0 is the y-intercept of the regression
line which measures the value of y when x = 0, β1 is the slope which measures the average rate of change
in dependent variable per unit change in independent variable, and E(y) is the mean or expected value of y
for a given value of x.

The estimated regression equation for simple linear regression follows.

ŷ = b0 + b1x

Multiple Linear Regression

A regression model that contains more than one independent variable is
called a multiple regression model.

The general multiple linear regression model is

y = β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 + ⋯ + βpxp + ε

Central tendency - This measures the extent to which all the values are grouped around a
typical or central value.
I. They give us an idea about the concentration of the values in
the central part of the distribution.
II. It is the value of the variable, which is typical of the whole set.
III. It represents all relevant information contained in the data in as
few numbers as possible.
IV. They give precise information, not information of a vague
general type.

Variation or Dispersion –This measures the amount of dispersion or scattering of values
away from a central value.

What is Dispersion?
• Measures of average (such as the median and mean) represent the typical
value for a dataset. But within the dataset, the actual values usually differ from
one another and from the average value itself.
• The extent to which the central value are good representatives of the values
in the original dataset depends upon the variability or dispersion in the
original data.
• Dispersion is the spread or scatter of item values from a measure of central
tendency. Dispersion is usually measured as an average of deviations about
some central value.
• Dispersion thus is a type of average and is sometimes called a second order
average. Datasets are said to have high dispersion or variation when they
contain values considerably higher and lower than the central value.

Variance: the variance shows, on an average, how close the values of a
variable are to the arithmetic mean.
The sum of squared deviations is σσii=11 nn (xxii − xx�)22. The following graph shows
the squared deviations of the values from their mean.

-----
Standard Deviation

• The variance represents squared units, and therefore is not appropriate
measure of dispersion when we wish to express the concept of dispersion in
terms of the original unit.
• The Standard deviation is another measure of dispersion. The standard
deviation is the positive square root of the variance and is expressed in the
original unit of the data.
• Standard Deviation of variable XX, SSSS(X) = �VVVVVV(XX)

Conditional Probability (Review):
Conditional probability is the probability of one event occurring based on the occurrence of a
previous event.

Bayes theoreom: 
posterior probablity= (likelyhood term*prior probablity)/evidence

----------
A random variable is a numerical quantity which is obtained as a result of a random experiment.
